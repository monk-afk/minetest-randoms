# Runtime Edit DoFile
Chat command /dofile will execute the dofile.lua

Changes to the dofile will be applied without server restart

Simply write your code, save the dofile and run the /dofile command from in-game

Makes writing and testing code, formscripts, pretty much anything way easier

Not recommended for live servers, intended for debugging only
